      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[                  I want to create an educational website about culture and the world around us. The website will be sort of like a magazine with different sections about things like photography, fashion, music, movies, and art. I know that lots of people like me are interested in these sorts of things but are tired of only hearing them from gossip magazines. That is why I want to create a magazine that is purely educational and doesn’t dive into pop culture drama. In each different area of the website will be about how interesting these different things are.  I want to create an educational website about culture and the world around us.

      <h3>Fashion</h3>
      <p>
        "Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions."- Coco Chanel
        Fashion plays a major role in the society we live in. Since ancient times people have taken great care into the way they dress as a sign of wealth or prosperity, but it wasn’t until 1770 a woman named Rose Bertin came along, she is often regarded as the first internationally famous fashion designer. She was the dress designer for Marie Antoinette (queen of France from 1770 to 1793). Fashion designers all over the world started to take inspiration from her designs and so started the fashion industry. Now fashion designers were not only running an individual business they were running an industry together. 
        Nowadays designers do the same thing. Today fashion is a 1.2 trillion-dollar global industry. From major designers like Gabrielle Hearst, Miuccia Prada, Stella McCartney, and so many more. But the designers are not the only ones running the industry today. There are trend forecasters, textile makers, models, fashion marketing, personal stylists, art directors, fashion journalists, and so much more. It is no surprise that the fashion industry plays a huge role in our world today.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.” ― Plato
        Music is often seen as a universal language that connects everyone. It is no secret that music is one of the biggest industries in the world today. Nowadays music is easy to find and almost everyone has some form a streaming platform from Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and many more. Music has changed and developed of time from composers like, Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. Who composed beautiful classical pieces to artists nowadays like Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, and Arianna Grande who sing lyrics and have songs produced to be on the mainstream radio. Music is unique in the way that everyone has their own taste and style not everyone likes the same music, but everyone can appreciate the impact it has made in our society that is why music is considered the universal language.
