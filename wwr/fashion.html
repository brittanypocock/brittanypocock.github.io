            Fashion plays a major role in the society we live in. Since ancient times people have taken great care into the way they dress as a sign of wealth or prosperity, but it wasnâ€™t until 1770 a woman named Rose Bertin came along, she is often regarded as the first internationally famous fashion designer. She was the dress designer for Marie Antoinette (queen of France from 1770 to 1793). Fashion designers all over the world started to take inspiration from her designs and so started the fashion industry. Now fashion designers were not only running an individual business they were running an industry together. 
            Nowadays designers do the same thing. Today fashion is a 1.2 trillion-dollar global industry. From major designers like Gabrielle Hearst, Miuccia Prada, Stella McCartney, and so many more. But the designers are not the only ones running the industry today. There are trend forecasters, textile makers, models, fashion marketing, personal stylists, art directors, fashion journalists, and so much more. It is no surprise that the fashion industry plays a huge role in our world today.
